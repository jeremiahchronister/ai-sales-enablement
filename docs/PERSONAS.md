## Anti-Personas (Not Our Target)

### ❌ Enterprise Sales Teams (1,000+ Reps)
**Why Not:**
- Need enterprise-grade security (SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, etc.) - we're not ready yet
- Complex procurement (6-12 month sales cycles) - we can't afford long sales cycles
- Custom SLAs and on-prem deployments - our cloud-only model doesn't fit

**Maybe in Year 3:** After we achieve SOC 2 compliance and have enterprise customers as references

### ❌ Solo Sales Consultants (1-5 Person Teams)
**Why Not:**
- Too price-sensitive ($150/user/month is expensive for solo consultant)
- Don't need team collaboration features
- Prefer simpler, cheaper tools (e.g., $20/month point solutions)

**Alternative Offer:** Freemium tier (5 users free, limited features)

### ❌ Non-Sales Teams (Customer Success, Marketing)
**Why Not:**
- Product is sales-specific (lead scoring, proposals, battle cards)
- Different workflows (CSMs don't do cold calls)
- Would require significant product changes

**Maybe in Year 2:** Expand to customer success (renewal proposals, upsell scoring)
